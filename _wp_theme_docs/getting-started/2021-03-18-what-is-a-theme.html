<p>A WordPress Theme changes design of your website. Changing your theme changes how your site looks on the front-end, i.e. what a visitor sees when they browse to your site on the web. WordPress themes may include<strong> layouts, asset files (css, js, icon, font) and more.</strong> You can find a lot of WordPress themes as example in the <a href="https://wordpress.org/themes/">WordPress.org Theme Directory</a>,&nbsp;</p>

{% include alert/info.html content="If you want to produce a theme for consumers, you should provide more useful tools with good design. This is primary key for success." %}

<h2>What can a theme do?</h2><ul><li>Your theme can have different layouts, such as static or responsive, using one column or two.</li><li>Your theme can display content anywhere you want it to be displayed.</li><li>Your theme can specify which devices or actions make your content visible.</li><li>Your theme can customize its typography and design elements using CSS.</li></ul>

<h2>What are themes made of?</h2><p>A basic theme should include some required files (<a href="/wp_theme_docs/index.php/">index.php</a>, <a href="/wp_theme_docs/style-css/">style.css</a>). You can see more information by clicking links. We recommend using <a href="https://underscores.me/">underscores.me</a> for creating a basic theme structure easily.&nbsp;</p>

{% include alert/info.html content="Underscores.me creates a basic template structure with useful tools. Also, you can find advanced theme usage examples like customizer in this template structure. You can develop your theme using this structure easily." %}

<h2>What is the difference between a theme and a plugin?</h2>

{% include alert/info.html content="A theme controls the presentation of content. Theme should only deal with what a visitor sees when they browse to your site on the web." %}

{% include alert/info.html content="A plugin is used to control the behavior and features of your WordPress site. Plugins expand WordPress core and add functionality. Therefore, if you want to add critical functionality with your theme, you should create a core plugin for your theme." %}

<blockquote><p>By moving critical features to plugins, you make it possible for the design of your website to change, while the functionality remains the same.</p></blockquote>
